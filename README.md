# Transport Management System
## Objective

Transport Management System is a web based application through which you will able to get all the reservation related data. It would provide you the platform to login and make reservations for a particular date, from one location to another. Its user’s friendly tools are very simple to use.

## Idea

The project uses a GUI application- 

The graphical user interface is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.
